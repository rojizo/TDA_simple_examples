# Very simple examples of persistent homology computations

We will using [Dionysus](https://mrzv.org/software/dionysus2/) or/and [GUDHI](https://gudhi.inria.fr/). 
There are other packages like, [Ripser](https://github.com/Ripser/ripser) or [TDA-bats](https://bats-tda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

If you  try to make 
[the code](https://github.com/WolfByttner/thesis_code/tree/master) from
the bachelor thesis *Classifying RGB Images with multi-colour Persistent 
Homology* , work you may have some problems if you are using Python3. 
I have some troubles with [diamorse](https://github.com/AppliedMathematicsANU/diamorse) package, that seems to be program for Python 2. I have changed a couple of bit to make it work in Python3 (`python3` branch at this [repo](https://github.com/rojizo/diamorse)).
